#Static Keyword
---------------
1. by using static Keyword the referance for properties of the class(variable and method) will taken common referance for all the classes and objects
2. It is possible to call/invoke the non-static and static properties into non-static methods
3. It is not possible to call/ invoke the non-static properties into static method, static method only accept static properties
4. static blocks always execute first only once and the non static execute when the object is created for a class(each time it will execute the non -static block)

#Hierarichy
----------
1. Execute the static always first in super class and then sub class only once with or without create object for the class
2. Next it will execute the non static blocks for super class and sub class for every constructor call
3. method

#this keyword
-------------
1. this keyword present same class/ current class constructor/methods/variables
2. The usage of this keyword is to resolve the ambiguity in method level/ constructor level


#super keyword
--------------
1. super keyword is used to access the super class properties(variable, method, constructor)
2. to resolve ambiguity like same method / variable declared in super class and sub class, but like to access the super class variable in sub class


#final keyword
--------------
1. If class is declared as final , Then the class can't be as super class
2. If the variable is declared as final the value for the variable is not possible to change.
3. If the method is declared as final then it is not possible to override


#Steps to execute the testcase without static keyword (Parallel Execution)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Remove the static keyword for the driver variable in ProjectSpecificMethod
2. In the testcase method Pass the driver value into the LoginPage constructor
3. Do mouseHover and Create a constructor for Loginpage
4. Inside the constructor assign local variable driver value to the global variable driver(this.driver = driver)
5. pass driver variable value for the all the constructor for pages class and also assign the variable value inside the constructor


#Steps to Handle MultiLingual Application by using POM
------------------------------------------------------
1. Create proprties files for each language
2. In the properties file use the same key for all the properties file and assign values for the key based on the language.
3. In the base class (ProjectSpecificMethod) Set the properties file location and load the properties file
4. use prop.getProperty(String key) in required places in pages class
